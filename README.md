🧪  Test code for studying through a variety of books, courses, or just random things I'm playing with.

🌐  There are some things that will run in a browser:

```
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

🐢  Some node (12) files (.js files in root):

```
node node/script.js
```

🐍  And some python 3 scripts in /py:

```
python3 py/file.py
```
